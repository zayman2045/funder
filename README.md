# Funder

Funder is a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) that runs a custom Solana on-chain program. 

## Overview

Funder leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide a secure, high-performance, and cost effective transaction platform. It is built on the Solana devnet blockchain, utilizing Typescript and Next.js for the frontend and Rust for the on-chain code. Once a user connects their Phantom wallet, the Funder UI provides access to two custom on-chain programs:

* Game Reviews
    * A review system where users can read and write reviews for their favorite video games
* Tokens
    * TODO

## Usage

Before using Funder, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node.js and npm are installed, cd into the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

```zsh
npm install
```

Then, you can start the application with:

```zsh
npm run dev
```
